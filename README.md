## Advent Of Code (AoC) 2022

This are my solutions to the [Advent Of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) event. This year I've been playing along with [timsearle](https://github.com/timsearle/) and [Sfrost007](https://github.com/sfrost007/), please check out their solutions if you're interested.

### Project approach

This swift package manager project contains my MacOS command line tool, a framework with all of the logic to solve the puzzles and a test framework to validate against the AoC examples that are given in the puzzle descriptions.

The idea is to use the example problems/solutions provided in the puzzles to do TDD, but sometimes there are no examples that allow TDD.

This project requires a `config.swift` file to be created. This is the format of the file:

```swift
import Foundation

enum Config {
    static let year = 2022
    // This is the session cookie from your browser after logging in to https://adventofcode.com/
    static let session = "[TOKEN]"
}
```

### Running

To run day 1:
- Either create a file called day1.txt with your puzzle input, or add your AoC session cookie to the code and it'll be created automatically
- Then run `swift run AoC 1` in Terminal
